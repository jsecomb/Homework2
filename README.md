Homework 2 - Responsive Repo

by Julian Secomb

Objective: To create a mobile-first portfolio website with design that displays optimally on devices with differing screen sizes. The site should aslo include a navbar, responsive images and contain three pages:
  - A index page with an 'about me' section and a short bio;
  - A portfolio page with a gallery` of repeating images overlaid with links; and
  - A contact page with a form that allows users to submit information.
  
Work done: I designed and built three pages matching the descriptions above using bootstrap's grid system. The user can navigate between the three pages using a navbar taken from the bootsrap template. The pages are designed to display properly on both small and larger screens. This is accomplished primarily by using bootstrap's pre-built column size options that automatically adjust when a screen is above or below 768 pixels wide. Media Queries are also used to make adjustments to the layout when the website is in the small screen mode. (For example, when a screen is larger there are margins on either side of the contact vs. a small screen is completely filled horizontally.)

This website is relatively "bare-bones" but will serve as a starting point for a more comprehensive portfolio site that will include some of the best work I do during coding boot camp.
